<p> Natural number: counting numbers are called Natural number.
✓ Denoted by N.
• Whole number: All-natural number together with Zero.
✓ Denoted by W.
• All-natural numbers, 0 and Negative of natural numbers form the collection of all integers.
✓ Denoted by Z from German word “Zahlen” means to count.
• Positive integers: are placed on the right-hand side Zero.
• Negative integers: are place on the left-hand side Zero.
✓ Denoted by the minus (-) sign before each number.
• Order of positive integers: Example: 2 is greater than 1
 2 > 1.
• Order of Negative integers: Example: -1 is greater than -2
 : -1 > -2.
• An odd Number is a whole number that can not be divided exactly by 2.
• An even number is a whole number that can be divided exactly by 2.
✓ The sum of two odd numbers = Even number.
✓ The sum of two even numbers = Even number.
✓ The sum of an odd number and an even number = Odd number.
• Factor: A whole number can be expressed as a product of two whole numbers include 1 and the 
number itself
• A number is divisible by 2, if the ones place is any one of the even numbers.
• A number is divisible by 3, if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.
• A number is divisible by 4, if the last two digits of the given number is divisible by 4 or Zeros.
• A number is divisible by 5, if the ones place is either 0 or 5.
• A number is divisible by 6, if its divisible by both 2 and 3.
• A number is divisible by 8, if the last three digits of the given number is divisible by 8 or zeros.
• A number is divisible by 9, if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.
• A number is divisible by 10, if its ones place is only Zero.
• A number is divisible by 11, if the difference between the sum of alternative digits of the number is 
either 0 or divisible by 11.
• Prime number is a number which has exactly two factors namely 1 and the number itself.
• Prime factor are those factors of a number which are prime number.
• The highest common factor (H.C.F) of two or more numbers is the largest common factor among all 
the common factors of the number.
• The lowest common multiple (L.C.M) of two or more numbers is the smallest common multiple 
among all the common multiples of the numbers.
• A number is squared when it is multiplied by itself.
• The square root of a number is the number that when multiplied by itself we get the number.
• A number is cubed when its multiplied and then multiplied by itself again.
• The cube root of a number is the number that was multiplied by itself to get the cube number.
• A fraction is a number that represent a part of whole number.</pre>
